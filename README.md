# DataHammer-Training-Room
Machine Learning Practice for students get in touch with Group `DataHammer`
This repo contains the `Machine Learning` Practice code for the shoolmate who will get into the group `DataHammer`

## 1. Project introduction
1. Project principal  
   * `Tian Lan`
   * `Hengda Xu`
   * `Chengxin Xin`
   * `Xianling Mao`
  
2. Goal of this project  
  In view of the need for new students to consolidate the foundation of the `Machine Learning`, it is believed that the best way for the next schoolmates to participate in laboratory activities is not simply to read a large number of papers for a small research field and questions. `Lan Tian` suggested to `Xianling Mao` that he hopes to create a learning style suitable for freshmens of group `DataHammer`, so the most appropriate way for the new students is to quickly understand the algorithm ideas and make it possible by coding some common problems that need to be processed by machine learning methods. And this is also the original intention of the establishment of this repo.
  
3. Requirements  
    * `Python 3`
    * `PyTorch 0.4+`
    * `sklearn`, `numpy` and some tools
